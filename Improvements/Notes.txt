Client Side Improvements

    Accounts SideBar
        Accounts Sidebar will have its own GET Request to get all the accounts user has access to   
                This will return - _Id, Account Name, Account Types

        The GET request will return all the data pertains to that account (In-network, OON, OpenIssues, PortalLogins)
            ...and it can be stored in a state - so while accessing each Tab subsequent get request is not necessary

          
Server Side 

    Create a new route to consume the GET Request from the Account-Sidebar
        If this properly implimented then Accounts, Providers & Users Date does not need to send with 
            ...the initial Payload (GetMyInfo)
